# Final Reflections on Python and SQL

On the last day of the project, you will review the following questions and record, individually, the observations you have and your current understanding of each topic. Once everyone on the team is finished documenting their responses to the questions, you will review them collaboratively.

On the following Monday, an instructor will join your team before you start the next round of individual learning and answer questions, provide expert guidance and context that you may have about any topic.

## Collaboration

- Do you feel that you and your team wrote comprehensive tickets and pull requests during the project? Let's review.
- Did your team have to resolve any merge conflicts when working on common modules/functionality? How was that handled?
- Did the team work on tickets in the correct algorithmic order? If not, what could be improved next time?

## Full Stack Development

- When you needed to support a new resource in your project, which code should you start with?
    1. Python
    2. CSS
    3. SQL
    4. JavaScript
    5. HTML
    6. Other
- Can you think of an example when a feature didn't work in your application? If so, how was the problem diagnosed and fixed?
- Discuss the appropriate times that the client should make requests to the API for data operations. When should the client get data? When should data be modified?

## REST and HTTP

- Did any of the resources that were supported by your API _(i.e. articles, comments, etc.)_ handled all operations uniformly, or did each support a different interface?
- Could you describe the common HTTP status codes that you used in this project, and for which methods they are the most appropriate?

## Databases

- Could you articulate the difference between how you worked with JSON in the client side _(i.e json-server)_ versus a relational database for this project?
- What does **flat data** mean?
- How is a many-to-many relationship represented in the database? When do you need to do this?

## Patterns and Strategies

- Do you feel that basic operations such as filtering data, joining related data, and ordering data were done by the database, your Python code, or your JavaScript code?
- Did your team ever have the opportunity to refactor either obsolete, over-engineered, or redundant, code when it was discovered?
