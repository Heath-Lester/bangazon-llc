# Automate Elastic Beanstalk Deployments

Once you've set up an Elastic Beanstalk deployment, read the [How to Deploy Django App on AWS Elastic Beanstalk with GitHub Actions and AWS Console](https://medium.com/@huzaifazahoor654/how-to-deploy-django-app-on-aws-elastic-beanstalk-with-github-actions-and-aws-console-441f9104e31b) article.

Scroll down to the **Section 2: Configuring GitHub Actions Workflow** section and follow the steps from there.

Once the action is set up, make a simple _(but verifiable)_ change in your API code and get it merged to `main`. Then go to the Actions tab on the Github repo and see if the action succeeds.
