## Python on WSL

Run the following two commands in Ubuntu terminal, pay attention to terminal - you may be prompted to run additional commands. Mac users skip to the next section.

```sh
sudo apt update

sudo apt install -y gcc make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev python-openssl python3 python3-pip
```

You MAY need to run this command (your terminal should tell you):

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

Then install Homebrew with this command.

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

## Python on Mac

First, install the XCode Command Line tools with the following command in your terminal.

```sh
xcode-select --install
```

You may get a message that it is already installed.

> **Instructor Note:** _If you need the student to ensure that the latest version of Xcode CLT are installed, have them to go https://developer.apple.com/download/more/?=xcode, download the latest version, and then install it._

### Install Pyenv and Python on Mac

```bash
brew install pyenv
pyenv install 3.9.1
pyenv global 3.9.1
```

Now, when you check the version of Python with the command below, it should return 3.9.1.

```sh
python3 --version
```

### Troubleshooting: Cannot Install pyenv on Mac Version

If you get a message that `pyenv` could not install on your machine due to your Mac version, you need to visit the [Xcode downloads page](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/), then download and install the most recent published version of Xcode in the list.

### Troubleshooting: System Does Not Recognize Global Version

Add the following commands to your `.zshrc` file in your home directory.

```sh
# Configure pyenv
export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
export PATH="/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin:$PATH"
export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/shims:$PATH"

if command -v pyenv 1>/dev/null 2>&1; then
  eval "$(pyenv init -)"
fi

export PYTHON_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--with-openssl=$(brew --prefix openssl)"
export CFLAGS="-I$(brew --prefix zlib)/include -I$(brew --prefix sqlite)/include -I$(brew --prefix bzip2)/include"
export LDFLAGS="-L$(brew --prefix zlib)/lib -L$(brew --prefix sqlite)/lib -L$(brew --prefix bzip2)/lib"
```

If try to run `pyenv install 3.9.1` and receive an error similar to the one below

```
BUILD FAILED (OS X 10.14.6 using python-build 20180424)

Inspect or clean up the working tree at /var/folders/r5/snljcx4x3dx8ccckm7hhdgy80000gn/T/python-build.20191008104728.34069 Results logged to /var/folders/r5/snljcx4x3dx8ccckm7hhdgy80000gn/T/python-build.20191008104728.34069.log
```

Run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
sudo installer -pkg /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg -target /
```

After this is completed, try running `pyenv install 3.9.1` again

## Install Pipenv

This tool will manage 3rd party software that is needed for each of your projects.

```sh
pip3 install --user pipenv
```

### Troubleshooting Pipenv

If you get `command not found: pipenv` when trying to run pipenv:

- Mac and Linux
  - Open ~/.zshrc and add:
    ```
    export PIPENV_DIR="$HOME/.local"
    export PATH="$PIPENV_DIR/bin:$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
    ```
- Windows
  - First run `python3 -m site --user-site`
  - Copy what that returns, replacing `site-packages` with `Scripts`
  - In the control panel add what was copied to the path
