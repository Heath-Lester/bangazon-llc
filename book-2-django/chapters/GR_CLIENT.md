# Gamer Rater React Client

Using Vite, start a new React client project that will interact with the Gamer Rater API over HTTP.

After the project is set up, you can copy the files from the `components/nav` and `components/auth` directories from any previous React client you have build to have some boilerplate code to start with. Once those initial files are in place, create a Github repository and make your initial commit and push.
