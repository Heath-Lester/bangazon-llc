# Ch.11 Gamers Joining Events

In this chapter, you are going to to allow gamers to sign up for an event that has been scheduled.

## Learning Objectives

- You should be able to remember that a custom action is a method on a ViewSet.
- You should be able to understand that a custom action allows the client to put a verb at the end of the URL to initiate a custom action.
- You should be able to remember that a custom action can specify which HTTP methods are supported by it.
- You should be able to understand that an API often does not want to provide the ability to directly manipulate some resources _(e.g. the Django User)_.
- You should be able to explain that custom routes allow a client to manipulate resources without needing a separate ViewSet for that resource _(e.g. the `login` and `register` actions)_.

## Custom Action

With Django REST Framework, you can create a custom action that your API must support by using the `@action` decorator above a ViewSet. For this action, you want a client to create a request that allows a gamer to sign up for an event.

You also want to allow a client to allow a gamer to cancel their signup for an event.

This mean that your custom action needs to support `POST`, and `DELETE` verbs.

There are actually many ways to design this, and this chapter will show you one of them. You are going to support requests to the following URL.

http://localhost:8000/events/2/signup

The resource is `events`. The route parameter of `2` specifies which event is being targeted. The `signup` method at the end is your custom action.

## Signup Method

Add the following method to your event viewset.

> #### `levelup/levelupapi/views/event.py`

```py
@action(methods=['post', 'delete'], detail=True)
def signup(self, request, pk=None):
    """Managing gamers signing up for events"""
    # Django uses the `Authorization` header to determine
    # which user is making the request to sign up
    gamer = Gamer.objects.get(user=request.auth.user)

    try:
        # Handle the case if the client specifies a game
        # that doesn't exist
        event = Event.objects.get(pk=pk)
    except Event.DoesNotExist:
        return Response(
            {'message': 'Event does not exist.'},
            status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST
        )

    # A gamer wants to sign up for an event
    if request.method == "POST":
        try:
            # Using the attendees field on the event makes it simple to add a gamer to the event
            # .add(gamer) will insert into the join table a new row the gamer_id and the event_id
            event.attendees.add(gamer)
            return Response({}, status=status.HTTP_201_CREATED)
        except Exception as ex:
            return Response({'message': ex.args[0]})

    # User wants to leave a previously joined event
    elif request.method == "DELETE":
        try:
            # The many to many relationship has a .remove method that removes the gamer from the attendees list
            # The method deletes the row in the join table that has the gamer_id and event_id
            event.attendees.remove(gamer)
            return Response(None, status=status.HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT)
        except Exception as ex:
            return Response({'message': ex.args[0]})
```

## Event Provider Method

In the event provider, create the function to be invoked when the current gamer wants to join a specific event. This request has everything the server needs to create the relationship.

1. The event via the `eventId` parameter
1. The user via the `Authorization` token

```js
const joinEvent = (eventId) => {
  return fetch(`http://localhost:8000/events/${eventId}/signup`, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Token ${localStorage.getItem("lu_token")}`,
    },
  }).then((response) => response.json());
};
```

## Join and Leave Buttons

Now you need to update your **`EventList`** component in the client to allow the user to leave or join an event. Note that the `joinEvent()` function was added the the deconstructed object from the event context.

Then that function is invoked when the join button - which is on the bottom of each event card - is clicked.

```jsx
import React, { useContext, useEffect } from "react";
import { EventContext } from "./EventProvider.js";
import { useHistory } from "react-router-dom";
import "./Events.css";

export const EventList = () => {
  const history = useHistory();
  const { events, getEvents, joinEvent } = useContext(EventContext);

  useEffect(() => {
    getEvents();
  }, []);

  return (
    <article className="events">
      <header className="events__header">
        <h1>Level Up Game Events</h1>
        <button
          className="btn btn-2 btn-sep icon-create"
          onClick={() => {
            history.push({ pathname: "/events/new" });
          }}
        >
          Schedule New Event
        </button>
      </header>
      {events.map((event) => {
        const attending = profile.events.some((evt) => evt.id === event.id);
        return (
          <section key={event.id} className="registration">
            <div className="registration__game">{event.game.title}</div>
            <div>{event.description}</div>
            <div>
              {event.date} @ {event.time}
            </div>
            <button className="btn btn-2" onClick={() => joinEvent(event.id)}>
              Join
            </button>
          </section>
        );
      })}
    </article>
  );
};
```
