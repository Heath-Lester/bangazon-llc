# Ch.7 Exposing Games

## Listing Games

## Learning Objectives

- You should be able to describe how to load some initial data into your database with Django.
- You should be able to create a file containing JSON representations of the resources for your database.
- You should be able to itemize the View methods needed to handle requests for getting all resources, single resources, creating resources, updating resources, and deleting resources.
- You should be able to identify the ORM method used to get a single item from a table.
- You should be able to identify the ORM method used to get all items from a table.
- You should be able to explain the effect of the `depth` statement when used in a Serializer.

## Learning Resources

- Documentation: [Providing initial data for models](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/howto/initial-data/)

## Preface: Seed the Database

Create the following fixture file and then seed the database with the loaddata command beneath.

> #### `levelup/levelupapi/fixtures/games.json`

```json
[
  {
    "model": "levelupapi.game",
    "pk": 1,
    "fields": {
      "title": "Welcome To",
      "maker": "Benoit Turpin",
      "gamer": 1,
      "game_type": 1,
      "number_of_players": 4,
      "skill_level": 3
    }
  },
  {
    "model": "levelupapi.game",
    "pk": 2,
    "fields": {
      "title": "Settlers of Catan",
      "maker": "Klaus Teuber",
      "gamer": 1,
      "game_type": 1,
      "number_of_players": 4,
      "skill_level": 4
    }
  },
  {
    "model": "levelupapi.game",
    "pk": 3,
    "fields": {
      "title": "Dungeons & Dragons",
      "maker": "Wizards of the Coast",
      "gamer": 1,
      "game_type": 2,
      "number_of_players": 5,
      "skill_level": 3
    }
  }
]
```

#### Load the fixture data

```sh
python3 manage.py loaddata games
```

## Step 1: The Game Model Class

You should already have the **`Game`** model for your application. If not, build it now after looking at the requirements in chapter 2.

## Step 2: The Game ViewSet

Time to write the brains of the operation. The ViewSet will handle GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests sent from a client application over the HTTP protocol.

> #### `levelup/levelupapi/views/game.py`

```py
"""View module for handling requests about games"""
from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError
from rest_framework import status
from django.http import HttpResponseServerError

        # and set its properties from what was sent in the
        # body of the request from the client.

        game.title = request.data["title"]

        """Handle GET requests to games resource

        Returns:
            Response -- JSON serialized list of games
        """
        # Get all game records from the database
        games = Game.objects.all()

        # Support filtering games by type
        #    http://localhost:8000/games?type=1
        #
        # That URL will retrieve all tabletop games
        game_type = self.request.query_params.get('type', None)
        if game_type is not None:
            games = games.filter(game_type__id=game_type)

        serializer = GameSerializer(
            games, many=True, context={'request': request})
        return Response(serializer.data)
```

## Step 3: The Serializer

The serializer class determines how the Python data should be serialized as JSON to be sent back to the client. Put the following code at the bottom of the same module as above.

> #### `levelup/levelupapi/views/game.py`

```py
class GameSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    """JSON serializer for games

    Arguments:
        serializer type
    """
    class Meta:
        model = Game
        fields = ('id', 'title', 'maker', 'number_of_players', 'skill_level', 'game_type')
        depth = 1
```

## Step 4: The URL

The last step is for the server to specify which URL it will respond to with information about games. In this case, you want to expose a `/games` resource at the end of the base API.

http://localhost:8000/games

and

http://localhost:8000/games/1

If any client submits a GET request to either one of those URLs, you need to clearly state that the **`Games`** ViewSet will handle the request. You will use a built-in class in Django called the `DefaultRouter`.

Add the following import statement at the top of the urls module.

> #### `levelup/levelup/urls.py`

```py
from levelupapi.views import GameTypes, Games
```

Then, add a new URL mapping to the default router.

> #### `levelup/levelup/urls.py`

```py
router = routers.DefaultRouter(trailing_slash=False)
router.register(r'gametypes', GameTypeView, 'gametype')
router.register(r'games', GameView, 'game')
```

## Client Code

You can start off with this starter React code to request and display a list of games from the API.

> #### `src/components/game/GameProvider.js`

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

export const GameContext = React.createContext();

export const GameProvider = (props) => {
  const [games, setGames] = useState([]);

  const getGames = () => {
    return fetch("http://localhost:8000/games", {
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Token ${localStorage.getItem("lu_token")}`,
      },
    })
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then(setGames);
  };

  return (
    <GameContext.Provider value={{ games, getGames }}>
      {props.children}
    </GameContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

> #### `src/components/game/GameList.js`

```jsx
import React, { useContext, useEffect } from "react";
import { GameContext } from "./GameProvider.js";

export const GameList = (props) => {
  const { games, getGames } = useContext(GameContext);

  useEffect(() => {
    getGames();
  }, []);

  return (
    <article className="games">
      {games.map((game) => {
        return (
          <section key={`game--${game.id}`} className="game">
            <div className="game__title">
              {game.title} by {game.maker}
            </div>
            <div className="game__players">
              {game.number_of_players} players needed
            </div>
            <div className="game__skillLevel">
              Skill level is {game.skill_level}
            </div>
          </section>
        );
      })}
    </article>
  );
};
```

> #### `src/components/ApplicationViews.js`

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { Route } from "react-router-dom";
import { GameList } from "./game/GameList.js";
import { GameProvider } from "./game/GameProvider.js";

export const ApplicationViews = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <main
        style={{
          margin: "5rem 2rem",
          lineHeight: "1.75rem",
        }}
      >
        <GameProvider>
          <Route exact path="/">
            <GameList />
          </Route>
        </GameProvider>
      </main>
    </>
  );
};
```
